# System requirements:
  have PyQt5 installed on your computer <br/>
  if you don't: open the command prompt and run:<br/>
                'pip install PyQt5' -- this should install pyqt5 on your machine<br/>
                
# Play the game:
  run the OXOGameServer<br/>
  run the Tictactoe game class(then connect to the server - 'localhost')<br/>
  run the Tictactoe game class again (then connect to the server - 'localhost' again)<br/>
  you should now have a given game symbol(nought or cross) on both game screens<br/>
  then play by clickingon which ever game board button you desire<br/>
