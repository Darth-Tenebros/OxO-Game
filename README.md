# System requirements:
  have PyQt5 installed on your computer
  if you don't: open the command prompt and run:
                'pip install PyQt5' -- this should install pyqt5 on your machine
                
# Play the game:
  run the OXOGameServer
  run the Tictactoe game class(then connect to the server - 'localhost')
  run the Tictactoe game class again (then connect to the server - 'localhost' again)
  you should now have a given game symbol(nought or cross) on both game screens
