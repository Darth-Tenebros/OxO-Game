helper files written by lecture: <br/>
  GameClient.py <br/>
  GameIni.py <br/>
  GameServer.py <br/>
  OXOGameServer.py <br/>

Game implementation written by me: <br/>
  Thread.py <br/>
  Tictactoe.py <br/>
  #################<br/>
  OXOTextClient.py is the text(command line) based version of the game <br/>
  


# System requirements:
  have PyQt5 installed on your computer <br/>
  if you don't: open the command prompt and run:<br/>
                'pip install PyQt5' -- this should install pyqt5 on your machine<br/>
                
# Play the game:
  Ensure that all the necessary files are in the same folder: <br/>
      GameClient.py <br/>
      GameIni.py <br/>
      GameServer.py <br/>
      OXOGameServer.py <br/>
      Thread.py <br/>
      Tictactoe.py <br/>
      cross.gif <br/>nought.gif <br/>blank.gif
      
  run the OXOGameServer<br/>
  run the Tictactoe game class(then connect to the server - 'localhost')<br/>
  run the Tictactoe game class again (then connect to the server - 'localhost' again)<br/>
  you should now have a given game symbol(nought or cross) on both game screens<br/>
  then play by clickingon which ever game board button you desire<br/>
  
  you will not be able to play if it's not your turn to play - keep an eye on the message box
